All files are valid json files: every key should be double-quoted.

The JSON output should be the default "pretty" json output provided by node, with two spaces indent.

## File Names

All filenames should be lower-case. Spaces should be replaced by dashes ("-").

### Date

Should have the "date" key on the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

### Tags

Always lower-case and singular.
