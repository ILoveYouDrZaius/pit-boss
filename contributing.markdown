All files are valid json files: every key should be double-quoted.

The JSON output should be the default "pretty" json output provided by node, with two spaces indent.

## File Names

All filenames should be lower-case. Spaces should be replaced by dashes ("-").

### Date

Should have the "date" key on the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

### Images

Every recipe should have an image. The image should live in the images folder relative to the main dish. Also, the image name should match the title of the recipe. If there are spaces, substitute them for hyphens.

*Example: chicken/images/easy-smoked-chicken-breast.jpg*

### Tags

Always lower-case and singular.
