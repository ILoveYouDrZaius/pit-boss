      "1. In a small bowl, mix all the ingredients.",
      "2. Rub the spice mixture thoroughly over the pork shoulder. Wrap the pork in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours.",
      "3. About 1 hour before smoking the pork, unwrap the pork shoulder and let it rest at room temperature.",
      "4. Heat your smoker to 225°F (105°C). This may require several additions of water-soaked wood to keep the smoke going. ",
      "5. When the temperature of the smoker has reached a constant 225°F (105°C), add the pork shoulder, close the lid, and adjust the vents so the smoke flows freely throughout the smoker.",
      "6. Cook until the meat is exceptionally and sigh-inducingly tender and reaches an internal temperature of 185° to 195°F (85° to 90°C), somewhere between 10 to 14 hours or about 1 1/2 hours per pound of meat. Let the meat rest for at least 30 minutes. ",
      "7. Slice, pull, or chop the pork. Demolish it immediately, doused with Vinegar Barbecue Sauce if desired."
